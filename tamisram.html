            <h2>Punishment</h2>
          
                
               <p> In Tamisram, the soul is sent to a dark and oppressive hell where it is continuously beaten by demonic beings. The torment is unending and serves as a consequence for the deceitful actions the soul committed. The environment is pitch-black, with no light or hope, symbolizing the darkness of the deceitful acts.</p>

                <p>The demonic beings are the enforcers of this punishment and are relentless and merciless. Their beatings cause both physical pain and mental anguish, reflecting the suffering caused by the soul's deceitful actions. The punishment is a constant reminder of the soul's misdeeds, offering no relief or escape.</p>
                
                <p>In this dark hell, the soul also experiences the psychological torment of isolation and despair.

This punishment is meant to cleanse the soul of its sins through intense suffering, preparing it for possible redemption in future lives.</p>
