            <p>Raurava is a place in Hindu mythology where bad people go after they die. It's a place of extreme suffering for those who have done very bad things, like hurting others or breaking important rules.</p>

            <h3>Reasons for Punishment</h3>
            <p>In Hindu stories, Raurava is for people who have done terrible crimes such as murder, torture, or betrayal. These actions hurt others badly and disrupt how people should live together.</p>
            <p>The punishment in Raurava matches how bad the crimes were. People who caused a lot of pain to others face similar pain in return, like a kind of fair punishment.</p>
            <h3>The Punishment</h3>
            <p>People in Raurava suffer a lot. They are surrounded by scary creatures that hurt them physically and mentally. The screams of pain and sadness fill the place, making it a terrifying place to be.</p>
            <p>The suffering in Raurava isn't just punishment. It's meant to make them realize how bad their actions were and make them sorry for what they did. This is seen as a way for their soul to become better and move towards a better life in the future.</p>
            <p>Raurava teaches the idea of karma, where every action has a consequence. It reminds people to be good and not hurt others, or else they might face similar pain later. This suffering is seen as a way to grow spiritually and become a better person in future lives.</p>
