            <h3>Reasons for Punishment</h3>
            <p>In Hindu mythology, Krimibojana is for people who have been extremely greedy and selfish. These people have taken more than they needed, often at the expense of others, causing suffering and imbalance in society.</p>
            <p>The punishment in Krimibojana matches their actions. Those who consumed excessively are themselves consumed by worms, reflecting the idea of reaping what you sow.</p>
            <h3>The Punishment</h3>
            <p>In Krimibojana, souls are eaten by countless worms. This painful and horrifying experience symbolizes the consequences of their greedy behavior. The worms represent the insatiable hunger that characterized their actions in life.</p>
            <p>This suffering is not just for punishment but also serves as a lesson. It aims to make the souls understand the harm caused by their greed and encourage them to change their ways and seek forgiveness in future lives.</p>
            <p>Krimibojana teaches the principle of karma, where every action has a consequence. It emphasizes the importance of living a balanced and considerate life, avoiding greed and selfishness.</p>
