            <h3>Reasons for Punishment</h3>
            <p>In Hindu mythology, Asipatravana is reserved for people who have committed serious crimes, such as harming others physically or emotionally. These actions disrupt the harmony and cause immense pain to the victims.</p>
            <p>The punishment in Asipatravana matches the severity of the crimes. Those who have inflicted pain and suffering on others are subjected to similar torment, symbolizing the idea of just retribution.</p>
            <h3>The Punishment</h3>
            <p>In Asipatravana, souls are lashed with sharp leaves made of iron. These leaves cut deeply, causing intense pain and suffering. The punishment is designed to reflect the harm they caused to others during their lives.</p>
            <p>This suffering is not just for retribution but also serves as a lesson. It aims to make the souls understand the consequences of their actions and encourage them to seek forgiveness and change their ways in future lives.</p>
            <p>Asipatravana teaches the principle of karma, where every action has a consequence. It emphasizes the importance of living a life of kindness and non-violence, encouraging people to avoid causing harm to others.</p>
