            <h3>Reasons for Punishment</h3>
            <p>In Hindu mythology, Tapana is reserved for people who have committed serious crimes such as murder, torture, and other forms of cruelty. These actions cause immense suffering to their victims and disrupt the moral order.</p>
            <p>The punishment in Tapana reflects the nature of their crimes. Those who have inflicted severe pain and suffering on others are subjected to similar torment, as a form of just retribution.</p>
            <h3>The Punishment</h3>
            <p>In Tapana, souls endure extreme heat and burning sensations. This painful experience symbolizes the intense suffering they caused to others during their lives. The heat is relentless, reflecting the severity of their actions.</p>
            <p>This suffering is not just for punishment but also serves as a lesson. It aims to make the souls understand the consequences of their cruel actions and encourage them to seek forgiveness and change their ways in future lives.</p>
            <p>Tapana teaches the principle of karma, where every action has a consequence. It emphasizes the importance of living a life of kindness and compassion, avoiding cruelty and harm to others.</p>
